# Feature Specification: Video Upload URL Generation API

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to implement a FastAPI backend in @amber_aim/ The API should be able to implement the following endpoint: /upload -> generates a signed AWS S3 path to upload a video there. Uses the boto3 sdk to generate the AWS S3 signed URL"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature requires video upload capability via secure URLs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: API clients, video uploaders
   ‚Üí Actions: request upload URL, upload video
   ‚Üí Data: videos, upload credentials
   ‚Üí Constraints: AWS S3 storage, secure signed URLs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: S3 bucket configuration - single or multiple?]
   ‚Üí ‚úì Resolved: No authentication required (public endpoint)
   ‚Üí ‚úì Resolved: 30-minute URL expiration (environment variable configurable)
   ‚Üí ‚úì Resolved: 2 GB maximum file size
   ‚Üí ‚úì Resolved: All video formats accepted (no restrictions)
   ‚Üí ‚úì Resolved: File naming uses base_path + UUID + original extension
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: client requests upload URL, receives signed URL, uploads video
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Upload request, signed URL, video metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties requiring clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: What authentication mechanism should protect the `/upload` endpoint? ‚Üí A: No authentication - Public endpoint, anyone can request upload URLs
- Q: How long should upload URLs remain valid before expiring? ‚Üí A: 30 minutes (configurable via environment variable)
- Q: What is the maximum file size that can be uploaded? ‚Üí A: 2 GB maximum file size
- Q: Which video formats should the system accept for upload? ‚Üí A: All video formats - No format restrictions
- Q: How should uploaded video files be named in S3 storage? ‚Üí A: Base path + UUID + original extension (e.g., upload/{uuid}.mp4); endpoint returns S3 path

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A client application needs to upload video files to cloud storage securely. Rather than uploading through the API server (which would create bandwidth and processing bottlenecks), the client requests a temporary, secure upload URL from the API. The API generates this URL pointing directly to cloud storage, allowing the client to upload the video file directly to storage without routing through the API server.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a client needs to upload a video file, **When** they request an upload URL from the API endpoint, **Then** they receive a time-limited, secure URL that allows direct upload to cloud storage
2. **Given** a client has received an upload URL, **When** they upload their video file to that URL within the validity period, **Then** the video is successfully stored in the designated cloud storage location
3. **Given** a client has received an upload URL, **When** the validity period expires before upload, **Then** the URL no longer accepts uploads and returns an appropriate error
4. **Given** a client requests multiple upload URLs, **When** each request is made, **Then** each URL is unique and isolated from other upload operations

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a client attempts to upload to an expired URL?
- What happens when a client uploads a file exceeding 2 GB?
- What happens when a client uploads an unsupported file format?
- How does the system handle concurrent upload URL requests from the same client?
- What happens if the client uploads incomplete or corrupted video data?
- How does the system handle requests when cloud storage is unavailable?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an API endpoint that generates secure, time-limited URLs for video uploads
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate unique upload URLs for each request using UUID-based file identifiers to prevent upload conflicts
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure generated URLs point to appropriate cloud storage locations for video files
- **FR-004**: System MUST configure upload URLs with 30-minute expiration times to limit security exposure (duration configurable via environment variable)
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate upload requests for basic integrity before generating URLs (e.g., request format validation)
- **FR-006**: System MUST return upload URLs in a standardized response format including the URL, S3 path, and expiration information
- **FR-007**: System MUST support video file uploads up to 2 GB via the generated URLs
- **FR-008**: System MUST accept all video file formats for upload without format restrictions
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure uploaded videos are stored persistently in cloud storage
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle errors gracefully when cloud storage is unavailable or URL generation fails
- **FR-011**: System MUST log all upload URL generation requests for auditing including timestamp, generated UUID, S3 path, and file extension
- **FR-012**: System MUST organize uploaded videos using a base path structure with UUID filenames preserving original file extensions (format: base_path/{uuid}.{extension})

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Upload Request**: Represents a client's request for a video upload URL, may contain metadata about the intended upload such as file name, content type, or size expectations
- **Signed Upload URL**: A time-limited, secure URL that grants temporary upload permissions to a specific storage location, contains expiration information and access credentials
- **Video File**: The media file being uploaded by the client, has attributes like format, size, duration, and resolution
- **Upload Session**: Tracks the relationship between a generated URL and the eventual upload outcome, includes creation time, expiration time, and upload status
